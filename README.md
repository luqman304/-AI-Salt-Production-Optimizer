# AI-Salt-Production-Optimizer

An AI-powered solution for optimizing Nigeria's large-scale salt production industry, focusing on efficiency, cost savings, and profitability.

## Overview

This project simulates and demonstrates the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence in Nigeria's salt production sector. It is based on public benchmarks from NASCON FY2024 and incorporates AI-driven modules to improve operational efficiency.

### Core AI Impact Areas

1. **Predictive Maintenance**  
   - Uses IoT sensor data and machine learning models to predict equipment failures.
   - Expected downtime reduction: 30–50%.
   - Maintenance cost savings: 10–25%.

2. **Energy Optimization**  
   - Machine learning-driven process control and demand forecasting.
   - Expected energy savings: 10–15%.

3. **Computer Vision Quality Control (CV)**  
   - Real-time defect detection using image processing.
   - Waste reduction: 5–8%.

4. **AI Logistics & Inventory Optimization**  
   - Route optimization and demand forecasting for transport fleets.
   - Transport cost savings: 10–20%.
